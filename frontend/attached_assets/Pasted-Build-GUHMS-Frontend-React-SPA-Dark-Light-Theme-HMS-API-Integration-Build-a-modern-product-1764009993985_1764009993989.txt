Build GUHMS Frontend – React SPA + Dark/Light Theme + HMS API Integration

Build a modern, production-ready single-page frontend for a Hospital Management System called “GUHMS” (Global Unified Hospital Management System).
The backend is a Java Spring Boot API running at:
Base URL: http://localhost:8080
Use the exact endpoints and payloads defined below.
The app must support Admin, Doctor, and Patient roles with separate dashboards, dark & light themes, navbar, footer, and smooth animations.

🧱 Tech Stack & Architecture

Framework: React (SPA) with TypeScript

Routing: React Router (role-based routing & protected routes)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (or similar) with full dark & light theme support

Animations: Framer Motion (or similar) for page transitions, modals, hover effects

State / Data: React Query / Redux Toolkit / Zustand (any modern option)

HTTP: Axios or Fetch with a centralized API client

Icons: Lucide / Heroicons / Material Icons

Images: Use high-quality medical images & illustrations (doctors, patients, hospital scenes, stethoscopes, dashboards) from royalty-free sources

🎨 Theming, Layout, Navbar & Footer
Dark & Light Theme

Implement a global theme system:

Light theme:

Background: soft white / light gray

Text: dark gray

Cards: white with shadows

Accents: teal / medical blue

Dark theme:

Background: dark slate / navy

Cards: deep gray with subtle borders/glow

Text: off-white

Accents: cyan/teal or purple

Requirements:

Theme toggle (sun/moon) in the navbar

Smooth animated transition when switching themes

Persist theme (e.g., localStorage) so reload keeps chosen theme

All components (navbar, footer, dashboards, tables, modals) respect theme

Navbar (Global)

Fixed at top for all main pages

Shows:

GUHMS logo/wordmark

Public links (before login): Home, Features, Contact, Login, Register

After login: role-specific nav (Admin, Doctor, Patient)

Theme toggle (dark/light)

Logged-in user avatar + dropdown (Profile, Logout)

Use glassmorphism / blur + shadow + hover effects

Footer (Global)

Always at the bottom of the page (or content)

Includes:

“GUHMS – Global Unified Hospital Management System”

Copyright

Links: Terms, Privacy, Help

Note: “Made with care for hospitals & patients”

Respects dark/light theme

🏠 Public Pages
Landing Page

Hero section with:

Medical illustration/image (doctor & patient, hospital UI, etc.)

Title: “GUHMS – Global Unified Hospital Management System”

Subtitle explaining benefits

Call-to-action buttons: “Login”, “Register as Patient”

Feature sections describing:

Admin Dashboard

Doctor Portal

Patient Portal

Smooth scroll + fade-in animations

Auth Pages
Login (uses /auth/login)

Centered card with:

Email

Password

Validation + error messages

On success:

Save token

Redirect to dashboard based on role in response

Endpoint:

POST /auth/login
Request:

{ "email": "admin@hms.com", "password": "Admin@123" }


Response:

{ "token": "...", "id": "...", "name": "...", "role": "ADMIN|DOCTOR|PATIENT" }

Patient Signup (uses /auth/signup-patient)

Form fields:

name, email, password, age, gender, contactInfo

Animated progress/loading

On success: treat like login, store token, redirect to patient dashboard

Endpoint:

POST /auth/signup-patient
Request:

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@hms.com",
  "password": "Pass@123",
  "age": 28,
  "gender": "M",
  "contactInfo": "1234567890"
}


Response: same shape as login.

🔐 JWT & Headers (Frontend Behavior)

After login/signup:

Store JWT token (e.g. in memory + localStorage)

All protected calls must include:

Authorization: Bearer <token>

Handle errors:

400 → show validation error

403 → “You don’t have permission”

409 → conflict (e.g. slot unavailable, email exists)

🧭 Role-based Dashboards
1️⃣ Admin Dashboard (role: ADMIN)

Main Endpoints:

Doctors:

POST /admin/doctors

GET /admin/doctors

GET /admin/doctors/{id}

PUT /admin/doctors/{id}

DELETE /admin/doctors/{id}

Patients:

GET /admin/patients

GET /admin/patients/{id}

PUT /admin/patients/{id}

DELETE /admin/patients/{id}

Payloads:

POST /admin/doctors Request:

{
  "name": "Dr. Smith",
  "email": "drsmith@hms.com",
  "password": "Dr@12345",
  "specialization": "Cardiology",
  "experienceYears": 10,
  "slotDuration": 30,
  "workingHours": [
    { "day": "MONDAY", "startTime": "09:00", "endTime": "12:00" },
    { "day": "MONDAY", "startTime": "13:00", "endTime": "17:00" },

  "experienceYears": 12,
  "slotDuration": 20
}


PUT /admin/patients/{id} Request:

{
  "age": 30,
  "gender": "F",
  "contactInfo": "9876543210"
}


UI:

Overview cards (animated counters):

Number of doctors

Number of patients

Today’s appointments

Doctor Management page:

Table with search/sort

“Add Doctor” modal using /admin/doctors

Edit/Delete actions

Patient Management page:

Table with search/sort

Edit/Delete actions

Use charts (e.g., Recharts) for:

Appointments per day

Doctor specialization distribution

All styled with dark/light theme & nice animations.

2️⃣ Doctor Dashboard (role: DOCTOR)

Key Concepts:

ISO-8601 UTC times (e.g., 2025-12-01T09:00:00Z)

Default slot duration: 30 minutes (but can vary)

Appointment statuses:
PENDING, ACCEPTED, REJECTED, VISITED, CANCELLED, RESCHEDULE_PROPOSED, RESCHEDULE_PENDING_PATIENT

Endpoints:

GET /doctor/appointments?date=YYYY-MM-DD

PUT /doctor/appointments/{id}/accept

PUT /doctor/appointments/{id}/reject

PUT /doctor/appointments/{id}/accept-keep-time (resolve double booking)

PUT /doctor/appointments/{id}/visited

PUT /doctor/appointments/{id}/extend

POST /doctor/appointments/{id}/prescription

GET /doctor/patients/{patientId}/history

Payloads:

PUT /doctor/appointments/{id}/visited Request:

{
  "actualStartTime": "2025-12-01T09:00:00Z",
  "actualEndTime": "2025-12-01T09:40:00Z"
}


PUT /doctor/appointments/{id}/extend Request:

{ "extraMinutes": 10 }


POST /doctor/appointments/{id}/prescription Request:

{
  "medications": [
    {
      "name": "MedA",
      "dosage": "50mg",
      "frequency": "BID",
      "duration": "5d",
      "notes": "after food"
    }
  ],
  "notes": "Rest and hydrate"
}


UI:

Doctor Dashboard:

Today’s appointments in a timeline or list of cards

Each card shows: patient, time, status, reason

Actions:

Accept / Reject

Mark Visited

Extend

Visual tags for statuses; highlight RESCHEDULE_PENDING_PATIENT and RESCHEDULE_PROPOSED

Double Booking Scenario:

If two appointments exist at the same time:

Surface a conflict indicator

Let doctor choose which appointment to keep original time (PUT /doctor/appointments/{id}/accept-keep-time)

Automatically, other overlapping PENDING appointments receive proposed new slot (status RESCHEDULE_PENDING_PATIENT)

Prescription UI:

In an appointment details modal/drawer, allow writing prescriptions via /doctor/appointments/{id}/prescription

Show previous prescriptions & visits:

GET /doctor/patients/{patientId}/history

3️⃣ Patient Dashboard (role: PATIENT)

Endpoints:

GET /patient/doctors

GET /patient/doctors/{id}

GET /patient/doctors/{id}/slots?date=YYYY-MM-DD

POST /patient/appointments

GET /patient/appointments

GET /patient/appointments/history

GET /patient/prescriptions

GET /patient/prescriptions/{id}

PUT /patient/appointments/{id}/accept-reschedule

PUT /patient/appointments/{id}/reject-reschedule

Payloads:

GET /patient/doctors/{id}/slots?date=YYYY-MM-DD
Response:

[
  "2025-12-01T09:00:00Z",
  "2025-12-01T09:30:00Z",
  "2025-12-01T10:00:00Z"
]


POST /patient/appointments Request:

{
  "doctorId": "<doctorId>",
  "slotStartTime": "2025-12-01T09:00:00Z",
  "reason": "General checkup"
}


Response: Appointment with status: PENDING.

PUT /patient/appointments/{id}/accept-reschedule

PUT /patient/appointments/{id}/reject-reschedule
Response: updated appointment (ACCEPTED or CANCELLED).

UI:

Dashboard:

Greeting: “Hi, [Name], welcome to GUHMS 👋”

Cards for:

Next appointment

Pending reschedules

Latest prescriptions

Mini calendar with appointment markers

Book Appointment Flow:

Doctor list (GET /patient/doctors):

Cards with doctor name, specialization, experience

Doctor detail & slots page (GET /patient/doctors/{id}/slots?date=…):

Grid/calendar of available slots

Click slot → Confirm modal → POST /patient/appointments

Appointments page:

Show upcoming (PENDING, ACCEPTED)

History tab for past visits

Reschedule Handling:

If appointment status is RESCHEDULE_PENDING_PATIENT:

Show original time (strikethrough)

Show proposed new time

Buttons:

“Accept new time” → /patient/appointments/{id}/accept-reschedule

“Reject” → /patient/appointments/{id}/reject-reschedule

Use toasts and animations on success

Prescriptions:

GET /patient/prescriptions → list with date, doctor, summary

GET /patient/prescriptions/{id} → full detail (modal or page)

🧮 Time, Slots & Status Handling (Frontend)

All times from backend are ISO-8601 UTC:

Example: "2025-12-01T09:00:00Z"

Frontend should:

Convert to local timezone for display

Format times nicely (e.g., “Dec 1, 2025 – 2:30 PM”)

Represent appointment statuses with:

Color-coded chips

Clear icons

Tooltips (e.g., RESCHEDULE_PENDING_PATIENT → “Awaiting your response to new time”)

🎬 Animations & UX Polish

Page transitions with Framer Motion

Hover + tap animations on cards and CTAs

Skeleton loaders while fetching

Toast notifications for:

Login success/failure

Appointment created

Reschedule accepted/rejected

Prescription saved

Smooth dark/light switch with subtle fade

✅ Final Objective

Create a fully functional, beautiful, dark+light themed, role-based SPA frontend for GUHMS that:

Uses http://localhost:8080 and the exact endpoints & payloads listed above

Implements:

Auth (login, patient signup) with JWT header

Three role dashboards (Admin, Doctor, Patient)

Doctor slot booking, double-booking conflict handling, rescheduling flows

Prescriptions creation & viewing

Includes a global navbar, footer, and high-quality medical imagery

Delivers a polished, production-quality UX.
